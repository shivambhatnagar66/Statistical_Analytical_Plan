# DIABETES CONTROL EFFICACY TRIAL (DiaCET-2024)
## A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Clinical Trial

### **BACKGROUND**:

Type 2 diabetes mellitus affects over 400 million people worldwide and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current standard therapies achieve adequate glycemic control in only 60-70% of patients. There is an unmet need for more effective treatments that can achieve target HbA1c levels while minimizing side effects.

### **STUDY OBJECTIVE:**

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of DiabetaMax (novel glucose-lowering medication) compared to standard care in achieving glycemic control and improving metabolic parameters in adults with inadequately controlled Type 2 diabetes.

### **STUDY DESIGN:**
- Phase III, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled trial
- 1:1 randomization to DiabetaMax + standard care vs. placebo + standard care
- 12-month treatment period with monthly monitoring
- Multicenter study across 4 major US clinical centers

### **PARTICIPANTS**:
- N = 300 adults (150 per treatment arm)
- Age 25-75 years with Type 2 diabetes
- HbA1c 7.5-12.0% despite standard care
- Diabetes duration 1-20 years
